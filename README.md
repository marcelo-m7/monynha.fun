# Monynha Fun – Cultural Video Curation Platform 🎬

![Monynha Fun Hero](./docs/placeholder.png)

> *A passion project by **Marcelo Santos**, crafted with care to bring together the best of cultural video content that gets lost in the algorithmic noise. Now with mention autocomplete because Marcelo got tired of copying usernames like it's 2005.*

**🌐 Live Platform**: https://monynha.fun

## 💭 What's This All About?

Look, I built Monynha Fun because I was fed up, sabe? Scrolling through YouTube, seeing the same algorithm-driven trash, while *amazing* cultural content just... disappears. So here's the deal:

We're creating a space where **human taste matters**. A place where curators (like you, like me) can say "ey, this video is worth your time" – and mean it. AI helps us out, sure, but **humans are in charge**. No predatory engagement metrics. No dark patterns. Just good content, properly organized.

### The Vision
- 🤝 **People > Algorithms**: Real human expertise, enhanced by AI (not replaced by it)
- 🌍 **Cultural Preservation**: Keeping the gems that YouTube's algorithm would bury
- 📚 **Community-Driven**: Every curator brings their taste, their knowledge, their soul
- 🎓 **Learning Through Playlists**: Organize videos into beautiful learning paths
- 🔓 **Open & Accessible**: Quality content for everyone, no gatekeeping

## 📸 See It In Action

### Homepage – Where Magic Happens ✨
![Homepage Screenshot](./docs/homepage.png)

Your first impression matters, né? Clean hero section, easy access to what's hot right now, and categories that actually make sense. No fluff.

### Discover Videos 🔍
![Video Discovery](./docs/videos.png)

Browse through categories that real people organized. Search, filter, read about *why* someone added a video. Simple as that.

### Create Playlists Like You Own The Place 📋
![Playlists](./monynha-playlists.png)

Build learning paths. Curate collections. Share with friends or the whole community. Your taste, your rules. You can even invite collaborators to help build something together.

### Comments & Community Interaction 💬
![Comments Preview](./docs/preview.png)

Every video deserves thoughtful discussion. Leave comments, reply to curators, share why a video matters to you. Build real conversations around content that resonates.

**✨ NEW**: Type `@` and watch the magic happen – autocomplete dropdown with user avatars, keyboard navigation (↑↓ to browse, Enter to select), and 300ms debouncing because we're not savages who spam the database. Works on mobile too. 📱

**🌍 Public Comments**: Everyone can read comments now – even anonymous lurkers. Good discussions deserve an audience. (Don't worry, only logged-in folks can post. We're not *that* crazy.)

No algorithms deciding what's visible – comments stay honest and community-driven. Tag people with `@username` and actually see their face pop up. Because UX matters, viu?

### Your Profile 👤
![User Profile](./monynha-profile.png)

Show the world what you're passionate about. Add a bio, customize your presence. People will see the videos *you* curated. Be proud of that.

## 🚀 Getting Started (It's Easy, I Promise)

### Set It Up Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Monynha-Softwares/video-vault

# Go into the folder
cd monynha-fun

# Install dependencies
npm i
# or if you're pnpm gang:
pnpm install

# Fire it up!
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** and boom – you're in.

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file (ask Marcelo for the keys, or set up your own Supabase project):

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

## 📁 How The Code Is Organized

The structure is clean and logical – I hate messy codebases:

```

├── components/              # Reusable UI pieces
│   ├── ui/                 # shadcn/ui components (don't touch upstream)
│   ├── playlist/           # Playlist-specific components

```

### Custom Hooks

The codebase includes several custom hooks to promote code reuse and maintainability:

#### `useVideoViewIncrement`
Manages video view count increments with optimistic UI updates:
```typescript
const { viewCount, showPlus, handleViewIncrement } = useVideoViewIncrement(initialCount, animationDuration);
```

#### `useRequireAuth`
Authentication guard for protected routes:
```typescript
const { user, loading } = useRequireAuth('/auth');
```

#### `use-mobile`
Detects if the user is on a mobile device:
```typescript
const isMobile = useMobile();
```

Every folder has a purpose. No random files lying around.

## � Available Commands

```bash
# Development server with hot reload (what you'll use most)
npm run dev

# Build for production (minified, optimized)
npm run build

# Build with dev settings (if debugging production)
npm run build:dev

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview

# Run the linter (keep code clean)
npm run lint
```

---

## 🐳 Deploying This Thing

We use Docker to keep everything consistent. Nginx serves the static build.

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t monynha-fun .

# Run it locally
docker run -p 80:80 monynha-fun
```

Then hit `http://localhost` and you're golden.

### Platforms That Work
- **Coolify** (recommended – simple, clean)
- Any Docker-compatible host (AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku, whatever)
- Vercel/Netlify (if you prefer that workflow)

Just make sure your Supabase env vars are set. That's it.

---

## 🔐 Making It Work – Environment Variables

You need two things from Supabase:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

These are public (it's fine, Supabase uses RLS to protect data). Create a `.env.local` file in the root and paste them in.

---

## 🗄️ The Database (Where The Magic Happens)

I designed the database with security and simplicity in mind:

### Core Tables
- **profiles** – User info (name, bio, avatar)
- **videos** – The actual content (title, description, YouTube ID)
- **categories** – Organized tags (Tech, Arts, Education, etc)
- **favorites** – Videos you bookmarked
- **playlists** – Your collections
- **playlist_videos** – Links videos to playlists (with ordering!)
- **ai_enrichments** – AI-generated metadata for each video
- **playlist_collaborators** – Share playlists with friends
- **playlist_progress** – Track watched videos in learning playlists

### Security First 🔒
Every table has Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled. Users can only see/edit their own data. Period.

No data leaks. No shortcuts. We take that seriously.

---

## 🎨 The Design System

### Tailwind CSS
No CSS files. No modules. Just clean utility classes. Responsive by default.

### shadcn/ui Components
High-quality, accessible components. We extend them when needed but don't modify the source (keeps upgrades smooth).

### Icons from Lucide React
Simple, beautiful, consistent. Covers almost everything.

---

## 🌍 Languages & Internationalization

Built with i18next so we can add languages super easily. Right now:
- 🇧🇷 **Portuguese (PT-BR)**
- 🇺🇸 **English (EN-US)**

More languages? Easy. Just ask or add translations to `src/i18n/locales/`.
